<h2 id="paypal">Paypal</h2>

<p>The Druid production deployment at PayPal processes a very large volume of data
and is used for internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams. Here
is what they have to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Around early Feb, 2014, the Paypal Tracking Platform team, lead by Suresh Kumar, stumbled upon an article talking about a new
upcoming kid in Real Time Analytics world. After first glance it seemed just like any other
new cool looking technology. But after reading little deeper into the papers(they had
referred) and few blogs, it was clear it is different. The fundamental approach to query
the data itself looked very different and refreshing.</p>

<p>Coincidently, at the same time, the team was struggling to create a very high volume real-time data
query system. We had already explored Drill, Hive, Cassandra, TSDB, Shark etc.
Dating back at least a year, none of these technologies were fulfilling our low latency needs for very high
volumes of data.</p>

<p>So, as an option we started the Druid prototype and within couple of weeks it was looking like
a very promising alternate. Very soon with great help from Core Druid development team
our prototype was doing great.</p>

<p>We then started the prototype with large 7-10 billion records and see the response time for
query. It was quite amazing.</p>

<p>Today our Druid implementation in PayPal processes a very large volume of Data and is
used for our internal exploratory analytics by business analytic teams.</p>

<p>The thing we liked the most was amazing support provided by core Druid team. I have never
seen a Open Source Community providing such a very high level of responsiveness for ANY
issue related to Druid setup and tuning.</p>
